			    <p><b>Origin:</b> Vienna, Austria</p>
			    <p>After graduating from Vienna International School, I went on to study film, media and sports studies at Stirling University in Scotland, as this was my passion since I was young; film and sports. During my time at university I joined multiple sports clubs including Muay Thai, Gaelic Football and Dance and had a radio show at Air3Radio. What was important was to build my CV, so I acquired two internships; one in Salzburg for MediaHaus and another in London for Turner Broadcasting, in which I gained a lot of experience in the field and further developed my creative passion. </p> 
		     	<p>During my last year at university I became aware of another interest I had which was sparked by a growing friendship with computer science students; computers, programming, blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Since then I have become more involved and technology minded, which is the field I would like to work in. Other than that I just love to travel and spend alot of time outside the country.</p>
